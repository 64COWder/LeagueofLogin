LeagueofLogin
=============

A League of Legends automatic log in script for those too lazy to type their password

The use of this program is quite simple. The first time you run the program it will create the ini config file and will notify you of such. You will need to open this ini file and put in your password and path to the League of Legends directory if you have moved it at all. After you have entered everything into the ini file just run the program again and enjoy not having to type your password!

This program also supports encrypting of your passwords so they are not displayed in plaintext format.
