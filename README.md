LeagueofLogin
=============

A League of Legends automatic log in script for those too lazy to type their password. In addition to loggin you in this program will also accept EULAS!

The use of this program is quite simple. The first time you run the program it will create the ini config file and will notify you of such. You will need to open up the settings panel by double clicking on the title bar to configure the program.

Leave the game path blank if League is installed at C:\Riot Games\League of Legends.

If you enable password encryption your passwords will not be shown in the ini file in plaintext. If you change, add, or turn off encrpytion the program will ask you if you wish to automatically update your passwords.

Under the Account Configuration you can add, edit or delete new account. This is where you want to add your accounts for autologin.

The Default Account section is where you can set what is shown in the dropdown by default when the program is launched. This does not have to be set and can be left blank.

If you do not wish to use the GUI that I setup with my blood and tears you can always edit the ini manually but you will need to relaunch the program if you want any changes to be reflected. Enjoy automatic login!
