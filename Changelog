Change Log
==========

1.5.6
- Minor fix to the login process. Riot added more things that are selectable with tab so more tabs are needed

1.5.5
- Removed windows activate code since the league client now auto-focuses itself when you are able to login
- Changed color detect to the current color on screen since the color is technically visible on an invisible layer before it shows on screen
- Changed delay down to one second since we are now waiting for the color to appear on screen

1.5.4
- Riot changed their client name again. This time its "League of Legends". Updated script to use this name instead.
- The original launcher is no longer needed so the code has been commented out. If this remains accurate it will be removed in a later update.
- Minor house keeping

1.5.3
- Riot changed the location of their client in the WinGetPos array. Updated search so it looks at the correct location
- The remember me checkbox at login now puts the focus in the password field. Added a check to see if this checkbox is checked or not

1.5.2
- Fixed update check

1.5.1
- Added forgotten EULA accept

1.5
- Updated script to work with the new public beta!
  - The code for the old script is still there just commented out
